Group B Final Project Proposal – A Reduced and Scaled Down Alternative to a Quadrocopter
Our project will be a simplified patient monitoring system like one that would be used in a hospital. 
There will be up to 3 Pi systems: one or two to gather data from the patient and send it to one acting 
as a server. The server will run a GUI in Java to display information. If three Pi systems are being used, 
the video and audio streaming will be the sole responsibility of one Pi. This project will require the 
purchase of at least a camera, a microphone, a thermometer and a heart rate monitor.
Some examples of information that will be gathered:
•	Heart Rate, to be taken from a heart rate monitor
•	Temperature
•	A video feed of the patient
•	Sound recording to listen to the patient
Some examples of things that we want to monitor but could be economically prohibitive or just dumb:
•	Blood pressure
•	A button to be pressed by the patient when they require attention
Milestones:
•	Week of the 18th – The GUI for the server should be mapped out
•	Week of the 25th – Sending of video and audio over a network should be researched and started
•	Week of Nov. 8th – The Java server should be done, should have various parts for testing
•	Week of Nov. 15th – Clients should be successfully transmitting temperature and heart rate to server, and displaying properly on the GUI
•	Week of Nov. 22nd – Video and audio should be streaming in real time and displaying on GUI
•	Week of Nov. 29th – Touching up GUI appearance, gravy, etc.
*Milestones subject to change

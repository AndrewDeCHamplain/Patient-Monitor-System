Patient-Monitor-System
======================

Our project will be a simplified patient monitoring system like one that would be used in a hospital. There will 
be up to 3 Pi systems: one or two to gather data from the patient and send it to one acting as a server. The 
server will run a GUI in Java to display information. If three Pi systems are being used, the video and audio 
streaming will be the sole responsibility of one Pi.
